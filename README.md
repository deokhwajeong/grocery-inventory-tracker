Scan grocery receipts to track fridge inventory and expiration dates automatically.  A simple Flask + SQLite app for managing groceries with manual entry (OCR extension planned).  CS50 Final Project: Grocery inventory manager using receipts and fridge tracking

#### Video Demo: <URL HERE>
#### Description:
Grocery Inventory Tracker is a simple web application built with Flask and SQLite that helps you keep track of the items in your fridge.  
With this app, you can easily record groceries (name, quantity, and purchase date) and view your fridge inventory in a clean dashboard.  

This project started as my **CS50x Final Project**, with the goal of solving a real-world problem: reducing food waste and making it easier to know what’s inside the fridge at a glance.  
While the initial version uses **manual entry**, it’s designed to be extended with **OCR (Optical Character Recognition)** in the future, so that grocery receipts can be scanned automatically to update the inventory.
